## Hacker News Post

**Title:** VisiBoard – Location-based social notes (Android, Open Source)

**Description:**

Hey HN!

I've been working on VisiBoard, a location-based social platform for Android. The core idea is simple: tie social media to actual physical locations.

**The Problem:**  
Social media has become disconnected from the real world. You scroll through posts that could be from anywhere, anytime. There's no spatial context.

**The Solution:**  
VisiBoard lets you drop notes at specific locations. Want to share a thought about your favorite coffee shop? Pin a note there. Curious what people are saying about a park? Check the map.

**Technical Details:**
- Built with Java and MVVM architecture
- Firebase for backend (Firestore, Auth, Storage)
- MapLibre for map rendering
- Custom image caching system (LRU, downsampling)
- ~15,000 lines of code
- Production-ready performance

**Performance Focus:**
I spent considerable time optimizing:
- Memory leak prevention (proper listener cleanup)
- Image caching with smart downsampling
- Background threading for heavy operations
- Fragment lifecycle safety
- ViewModels for state preservation

**Open Source:**  
MIT License, available on GitHub. The codebase includes extensive documentation and performance reports.

**What's Next:**
- AR camera overlay for notes
- Photo attachments
- Better search/filtering
- iOS version

I'd love to hear the HN community's thoughts on:
1. The concept of location-based social
2. Technical implementation
3. Privacy considerations
4. Feature ideas
